some of the tools that I daily use, mainly shell, python or php scripts

## NOTICE : 
I have just used these scripts in the OSX

So I can't ensure that they can work well under linux or other environment

*** 

**1. hs** 

    script : src/hs.sh

    filter duplicate and short command.
    it's more frindly and easy-use than the build-in history 
    and it also displays better.
    
    TODO : the filter via days and weeks

| commad        | tips           | more  |
| ------------- |:-------------: | -----:|
| hs            | the last 20 (default 20, and you can change it) |  |
| hs -10        | the last 10        |    |
| hs 10         | the earliest 10      |     |
| hs a          | all      |     |
| hs -c         | backup history, then clear it      |     |
